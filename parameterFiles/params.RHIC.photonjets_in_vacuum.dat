# This is an example parameter file.
# Let's write output to another file:
LOGFILE logs/RHIC_photonjets_vacuum_nevt_1000.log
HEPMCFILE eventFiles/RHIC_photonjets_vacuum_nevt_1000.hepmc
# for random number generation
NJOB 9
#how many events to run
NEVENT 1000
#change root s to LHC run 2 energies
SQRTS 200
# specify dijet production
PROCESS PPYJ
# Let's change the generation phase space:
PTMIN 30
PTMAX -1
# oversampling power
WEXPO 0
# this is to include recoil effects
KEEPRECOILS T
# to write the output necessary for subtraction of the thermal momentum components
WRITESCATCEN T
# to write out dummy particles (needed for 4MomSub subtraction)
WRITEDUMMIES T
# And we also want to change the medium parameters:
MEDIUMPARAMS medium.params.dat
