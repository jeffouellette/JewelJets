# This is an example parameter file.
# Let's write output to another file:
LOGFILE logfile/djet_nevt_10k_medium_recoils_OFF.log
HEPMCFILE HEPMC/djet_nevt_10k_medium_recoils_OFF.hepmc
# for random number generation
NJOB 73
#how many events to run
NEVENT 10000
#change root s to LHC run 2 energies
SQRTS 200
# specify dijet production
PROCESS PPJJ
# Let's change the generation phase space:
PTMIN 30.
PTMAX -1.
# to avoid pT sampling set exponent weight to 0
WEXPO 0
# this is to include recoil effects
KEEPRECOILS F
# to write the output necessary for subtraction of the thermal momentum components
WRITESCATCEN T
# to write out dummy particles (needed for 4MomSub subtraction)
WRITEDUMMIES T
# And we also want to change the medium parameters:
